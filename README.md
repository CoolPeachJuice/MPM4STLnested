# MPM4STLnested

## Overview
MPM4STLnested is a model predictive framework designed for the online monitoring of dynamical systems with respect to Nested Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. The framework ensures that a system's behavior remains consistent with temporal logic requirements over time, making it particularly useful for systems where long-term planning and safety are essential.

## Features
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) for dynamical systems
- Real-time monitoring and adaptation to STL specifications
- Nested STL specifications for complex temporal behavior enforcement
